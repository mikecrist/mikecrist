### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Mike**, and I am a Senior Manager of Design Engineering / aspiring Data Scientist!  I obtained my Master of Analytics degree from Georgia Tech in December 2023.  The projects you will find on this profile are a selection of some of the projects that I worked on while at Georgia Tech.

I am presently living in Atlanta, GA, and I work as Senior Manager of Design Engineering within the Digital Lighting Networks organization at Acuity Brands.  I have a Master's degree in Analytics from Georgia Tech, and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Penn State.
